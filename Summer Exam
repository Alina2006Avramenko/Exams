print("Welcome to the driving licence eligibility checker")# this line of code welcomes the user and let him/her now what does this program do
name = input("What is your name?")#this line creates a variable "name" and asks the user to enter his/her name and then "name" will be equal to the word that the user has entered 
age=int(input("What age are you?"))#this line creates a variable "age" and asks the user to enter his/her age and then "age" will be equal to the number that the user has entered 
print("You entered ", age)# this line print user's age <using information from variable "age"
if (age <17):#if statement compares "age" to 17
    print(name,"you are not entitled to apply for a driving licence.") #if it is less than 17 it prints that user is not entitled to apply for a driving licence
elif (age >=17 and age <=74):#if statement compares "age" to 17 and 74
    print(name,"you are entitled to apply for a driving licence.")#if it is greater  or equal to 17 and less than or equal to 74 it prints that user is entitled to apply for a driving licence
else:#if statement compares "age" to 74
    print(name,"you are entitled to apply for a three-year driving licence.")#if it is greater than 74 it prints that user is entitled to apply for a three year driving licence

import random

while ( True):# while loop is created and it will work until it is true

    if (guess > number ):#compares "guess" and "number"

        print("Well done, you won! My number was :",number )#if the user guessed the number right and "guess" is equal to "number" than the user will get the message that he won and the loop will break
